Well...  Today we got a quick train to Sheringham.  Why?  Because we were going
to buy a bus!  As it happened, there was a fair bit of nasty rain around, so when
we arrived it was great to find Simon from @RetroCampersNorfolk waiting to give
us a lift.  But I suppose we were about to hand over Â£[REDACTED] so perhaps a
free taxi ride wasn't so much to expect.

And some more...
