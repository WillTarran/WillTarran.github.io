<h2 id="oh-dear">Oh dear!</h2>

<p>So it had to happen, and today it did!  A quick trip to pick up some supplies and Buddy wouldn’t start…
An hour or so wait for the AA, which unfortunately didn’t lead to a solution, led to another wait for
a pickup truck.  So back at the garage, only a few hours after the indicator fix…</p>

<p>It really is about time I got better at fixing things!</p>
